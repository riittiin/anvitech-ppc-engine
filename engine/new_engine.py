"""Adapter — run the NEW scheduling engine behind the old build's scheduler seam.

The old build turns prioritized batches into a schedule through ONE dispatch point
(engine/pipeline.py `scheduler_for` -> `run(...)`). This module provides a `run` with the
SAME contract that internally drives the new operator-stable engine (vendored as the
`ppc_engine` package) and maps its output back to the old `ScheduleEntry` list — so the
entire old UI (Gantt, Analytics, Schedule, Orders, Capture-Actuals) keeps working
unchanged while the *scheduling brain* is the new one.

Why this is safe: the new loaders produce byte-identical machine ids / item codes /
operator names to the old loaders on the same workbook (verified: 26/26 machines, 98/98
routings, 19/19 operators). So the new engine's output references exactly the ids the old
view layer looks up. We therefore load the new masters natively from the stored workbook
(no masters translation) and only bridge three things:
    demand : old Batch   -> new Order
    config : old Config  -> new PlanConfig
    output : new Segment -> old ScheduleEntry (one entry per operation; the new engine's
             per-shift Segment split becomes the entry's `op_segments`).
