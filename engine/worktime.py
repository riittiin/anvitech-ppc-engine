"""Working-time calendar used by Rule 6.

A ``WorkClock`` advances real machine-busy time across only working periods. It is
built from a **list of day-relative intervals** (minutes from midnight; an end
> 1440 means the interval crosses into the next day), so different machines can
have different windows:

  * two-shift machine (08:00 → 05:00 next day):  ``[(8*60, 24*60 + 5*60)]``
  * single-shift / manual (09:00 → 18:00):       ``[(9*60, 18*60)]``
  * second shift only (19:00 → 05:00 next day):  ``[(19*60, 24*60 + 5*60)]``

Thursdays (weekly off) + holidays are skipped (``WorkCalendar``).

``advance(start, minutes)`` returns the datetime reached after consuming
``minutes`` of working time from ``start`` (snapping ``start`` forward to the next
working window first). ``advance(start, 0)`` snaps a time onto the next working
instant. A clock with **no intervals** raises ``NoWorkingWindow`` rather than
looping — callers (Rule 6) treat that as "this machine can't run".

Back-compat: ``WorkClock(calendar, config)`` (passing a Config) builds the legacy
single two-shift window, identical to the old behaviour.
