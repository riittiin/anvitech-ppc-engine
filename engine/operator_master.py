"""In-app Operator & Shift master + Friday rotation (pure).

The Excel "Operator & shift Master" sheet is only ever used to **seed** this
table once (see the spec, ``docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-18-operator-master-
rotation-design.md``). After that, operators live in the durable store
(``engine/book_store.py``) and a re-upload never touches them.

Purity: every function here takes ``today: date`` as an explicit parameter.
No ``datetime.now()`` / ``date.today()`` calls inside this module — callers
(the API layer) supply "now" so the logic stays deterministic and testable.
