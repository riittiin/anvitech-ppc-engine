"""Operator + shift coverage → per-machine working windows (pure, no IO).

The shop rule: an activity can run on a machine during a shift only if at least one
operator who (a) specialises in that machine and (b) is assigned to that shift is
available. A machine's working window is the union of the shift windows it is
covered for, intersected with what its Available Hrs/Day allows:

  * two-shift machine (Available Hrs/Day ≥ threshold, ≈19.5): eligible First
    (08:00-19:00) + Second (19:00-05:00); runs the shifts that have a qualified
    operator.
  * single-shift / manual resource (≈9.5): eligible 09:00-18:00 only, and only if a
    FIRST-shift operator qualifies (manual work runs first shift).

Operator specialties match a machine by its machine_no OR its (normalized) type, so
both "CNC 1" and "Milling M/c"/"Manual Deburring" style entries resolve. Provisional
machines (routing-referenced, not in the master) bypass the gate and keep a
two-shift window so nothing silently disappears.

Windows are lists of (start_min, end_min) minutes-from-midnight; an end > 1440
crosses midnight. Feed them straight to ``WorkClock``.
