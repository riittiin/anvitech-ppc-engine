"""Rule 6 — Allocate each process to the earliest-available preferred machine.

This is a **non-delay scheduler**: machines never sit idle while there is work
they could be doing. At every step it looks at the next ready operation of every
batch and starts the one that can begin earliest on its machine. Ties are broken
by the priority Rules 1–3 produced (earlier delivery, then more process time).

Why non-delay matters: the whole point of a PPC engine is keeping machines
running. The moment a machine finishes a batch's operation, the next operation
that needs it (from any batch whose predecessor is already done) takes it — the
machine does not wait for a higher-priority batch whose operation isn't ready
yet. Priority only decides between operations that are *equally* ready.

Each operation respects:
  * the working calendar (Thursdays off, holidays) and shifts — via WorkClock,
  * machine availability (one operation at a time per machine),
  * Rule 4 (setup time) for occupancy,
  * Rule 5 (overlap mode) for when the next process of the same batch may start.

Pure function: ``run(prioritized_batches, config, notes, masters) -> list[ScheduleEntry]``.
Raises RuleError on a contract violation (e.g. a batch with no routing).
