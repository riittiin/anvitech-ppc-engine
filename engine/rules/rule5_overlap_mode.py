"""Rule 5 — Operation overlap mode (calc helper, consumed inside Rule 6).

Global per-run toggle deciding when the NEXT process may start relative to the
previous one:
  * sequential  — next starts only after the previous is fully complete (100%).
  * overlap     — next starts after overlap_percent (default 50%) of the
                  previous process's CUTTING time has elapsed.

The percentage applies to the **cutting time only** (cycle x qty), NOT the
90-min setup: while the previous operation cuts, the next machine can be set up
in parallel, so the previous setup is not counted. A step with **no cutting
time** (a finishing / inspection step) cannot meaningfully overlap — its
successor waits for it to fully complete.

``elapsed_before_next(prev_occupancy_min, prev_run_min, config)`` returns how
many minutes after the previous process STARTS the next one may begin. Rule 6
then walks that many *working* minutes forward on the working calendar.
