"""The pipeline + trace backbone — the engine's debug spine (Design spec §5).

``run_rule`` wraps every rule call and snapshots its input table, output table,
config, and decision notes into a trace dict. The per-rule frontend tabs render
that trace, so rules themselves need no UI code.

A rule that detects a contract violation raises ``RuleError``; the pipeline
records it in that rule's trace entry and STOPS the chain (fail loud, fail
localized). Downstream rules are marked "not reached".
