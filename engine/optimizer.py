"""The Optimize feature's sequence search (pure; no state, no UI, no I/O).

Rule 6 is a greedy, single-pass, non-delay scheduler: it builds exactly ONE plan,
and whichever operation is ready first claims the machine — so the same unlucky
orders can lose every near-race for weeks (measured on the real book: 723
order-days of queueing, 74% of it waiting for CNC/VMC). The batch sequence fed
into Rule 6 is worth days of makespan by itself, and one full plan evaluates in
well under a second — so instead of trusting one greedy pass, this module SEARCHES:
try a sequence, replay the unchanged Rule 6, score the plan, keep the best.

Design contract (see the 2026-07-13 optimize-plan spec):
  * Reuses the unchanged Rules 1→2→3 (once) and Rule 6 (per evaluation) — never
    duplicates rule logic.
  * Deterministic: same so_lines + config + masters + budget + seed → identical
    result, on any machine (budget counts EVALUATIONS, not wall-clock).
  * The result is a rank per composite order key "<SO No>\x1f<Item Code>";
    ``pipeline.apply_priority_rank`` replays it, and replaying reproduces exactly
    the metrics reported here (the "what you Apply is what you get" guarantee).
  * ``reserved`` (blocked machine/operator intervals — today: operator absences)
    is passed through to every Rule 6 evaluation, so those windows stay clear.

# 2026-08-06 (owner: "we care only about the deliveries-on-time thing"): makespan

# to minimize BOTH late days and schedule length; that note recorded the trade
# honestly — raising 10 -> 40 moved the live book from 78.4 d / 1327 late-days to
# 72.7 d / 1528, i.e. it bought 5.7 schedule days for 201 extra late-days. The goal
# is now on-time delivery only, which makes that trade the wrong way round. 0.1

# its delivery date in EITHER direction, ignore the first ONTIME_BAND_DAYS, cap the
# rest, and square it.
#
# Squaring is the mechanism the owner asked for by name: ten orders 6 days out
# (10 x 2^2 = 40) must beat one order 30 days out ((30-4)^2 = 676). The cap stops a
# single hopeless order swamping the plan. The band is FLAT by owner decision — no

# instead — how many transfer chunks a batch flows between steps in. Measured
# on the live book: 4 best (49.6 d), 6 close, 1 = no pipelining (56.6 d).
# Flow evals are ~1.5s each (5x classic), so a contest must be SHORT enough to
# fit the cloud's 20-min window on 2 vCPU: 2 candidates run in ONE parallel round
# (~13 min wall for 400 evals each), 3+ candidates need a second round and time
# out. Chunk 4 is the reliable winner (43.7 d at depth), 6 the close runner-up;
# 1/2/3 lost every measured contest. So the lineup is exactly (4, 6).

# flow eval is ~15s, so a full 1000-eval search would run for HOURS. Cap it hard
# — a short search still yields the ~50 d / far-fewer-late-days class, a big win
# over classic, without hanging the free instance.
