"""Rule 5 — overlap mode: the % applies to CUTTING time only, setup excluded.

Machine occupancy = cutting time (cycle x qty) + a 90-min setup. Overlap measures
the percentage against the CUTTING portion only — the next machine's own setup
runs in parallel, so the previous operation's setup is not counted. A step with no
cutting time (a finishing/inspection step) does not overlap: the next step waits
for it to fully complete.

``elapsed_before_next(prev_occupancy_min, prev_run_min, config)`` returns how long
after the previous operation STARTS the next operation may start.
