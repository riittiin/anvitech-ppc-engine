"""Cross-feature consistency: every surface must report the SAME completion date for
the same (SO#, item), derived from the SAME plan run.

Live 2026-08-07: the Gantt said 07-Sep and the delay justification report said 04-Sep
for one order. Two independent causes, both pinned here:

  1. The delay report built its OWN plan instead of reading the one every other tab
     shows (``_plan``'s cached run).
  2. The auto plan-start floor (``_ceil_next_hour(now)``) was recomputed on every
     planning entry, so two runs a few hours apart produced materially different
     schedules from identical inputs — measured on the real book: a 6-hour gap moved
     54 of 68 orders' completion dates, worst case by 24 days.
