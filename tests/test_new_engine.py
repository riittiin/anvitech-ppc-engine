"""Tests for the new operator-stable engine driving the old build (engine/new_engine.py).

Runs on a fully-staffed synthetic workbook (tests/new_sample_workbook.py) so the new
engine actually schedules it. Headline guarantees — true on any input:
  * NO fragmentation: every operation runs on ONE machine.
  * NO operator ping-pong: one operator per (machine, shift); an operator is never on two
    machines in the same shift (the exact rule the old system broke).
  * NO double-booking of a machine or an operator.
  * per-process feedback: a finished step re-plans as a zero-time milestone.
  * the optimizer's rank map replays to the same plan it found.
  * the whole old UI (pipeline -> Gantt + Analytics) builds from the new engine's output.
