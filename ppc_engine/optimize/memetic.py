"""Memetic algorithm — a genetic algorithm whose offspring are polished by local
search. The state-of-the-art shape for this problem class (OPTIMIZATION.md).

Why memetic (GA + local search) rather than plain GA or plain local search:
  - The population + crossover give *diversity* — a way to escape the single-basin
    trap that iterated local search can fall into (the fairness sweep showed the
    search, not the objective, is the bottleneck).
  - The local-search polish gives *sample-efficiency* — critical because each schedule
    evaluation costs ~0.6s, so we can't afford a purely random GA.

Guarantees match the ILS optimizer: never worse than the best dispatch-rule seed
(elitism + seeded population), and deterministic (fixed seed + evaluation budget).
