"""Overlap contest — discover the best overlap value for THIS order book.

The optimal operation-overlap is book-specific (0.8 wins one book, 0.7 another). So we
don't hardcode it: this runs the sequence optimizer at each candidate overlap and keeps
the best (overlap, sequence) overall.

Fairness of the contest (a measured lesson from the old build, LESSONS.md B7): every
candidate gets the SAME search budget — otherwise a candidate that happened to search
deeper wins on effort, not merit. Candidate 0.0 (no overlap) is always included, so the
contest can only ever match or beat the sequential plan, never lose to it.

    Instead of a fixed grid, this treats "best objective score achievable at overlap x"

    search**: keep a bracket around the optimum and shrink it ~38% per step by probing
    interior points — spending evaluations *near* the optimum, converging to a
    continuous value (0.72, 0.87, whatever it truly is), not a grid point.

    Robustness (the whole point): a short **coarse pass** first brackets the peak so the
    search can't start on the wrong slope of a noisy function, and every probe is
    **best-of-`seeds`** so one unlucky optimizer run can't send the search astray. The
    returned overlap is the best *ever probed*, not just the final bracket midpoint.

    Honest limits: assumes the overlap→score response is roughly single-peaked
    (physically reasonable — too little overlap gives little gain, too much starves the
    successor). Precision is bounded by the optimizer noise floor; more seeds / larger
    `budget_per_eval` tighten it. Deterministic for fixed arguments.
