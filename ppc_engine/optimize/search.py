"""Iterated local search over the order sequence.

This is Layer 2's first optimizer. It is the *local-search* half of the planned
memetic algorithm (OPTIMIZATION.md) — chosen first because at ~0.6s per schedule
evaluation it is far more sample-efficient than a full genetic algorithm: it spends
its scarce evaluations on *guided* moves (pull the most-tardy orders earlier) rather
than random population churn. A GA population layer can wrap this later.

Design guarantees:
  - **Never worse than the best dispatch rule** — the seeds are evaluated first and
    kept as the incumbent; a move is accepted only if it strictly improves.
  - **Deterministic** — a fixed seed + an evaluation budget → the same result every
    run ("what you Apply is what you get").
  - **Objective-driven** — scored only through engine.objective (total tardiness +
    fairness + makespan). The search knows nothing about how the score is built.
