    """Configuration for a single plan.

    Time knobs:
        plan_start:  The datetime the plan clock starts from (nothing is scheduled
                     before this). A concrete datetime keeps the engine pure — the
                     API is responsible for resolving "today" into this value, so the
                     engine never has to know the real clock (a lesson from the old
                     build's magic ``None`` = today convention).
        first_start / first_end:   First-shift clock times (default 08:00 → 19:00).
        second_start / second_end: Second-shift clock times (default 19:00 → 05:00
                     next day). ``second_end`` < ``second_start`` means it crosses
                     midnight.
        week_anchor: A Friday used as the reference for operator shift rotation.
                     Operators flip shift each Friday after this date. Defaults to the
                     Friday on/before ``plan_start`` (resolved by the caller).

    Scheduling knobs:
        setup_min:   Setup minutes charged once per *machining* operation (RULES.md).

    Objective weights (used only by objective/objective.py):
        fairness_weight:  λ — weight on the worst single-order lateness (the
                          no-starvation guard, RULES.md Rule 3).
        makespan_weight:  w — weight on makespan (a strict secondary goal).
