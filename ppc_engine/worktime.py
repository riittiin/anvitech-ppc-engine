"""Working-time model — turns the calendar + shift clock into concrete time windows.

Two jobs:
  1. Compute a shift's real start/end datetimes (handling the night shift that
     crosses midnight).
  2. Walk forward through a machine's working windows, skipping non-working time
     (Thursdays, holidays, and the night shift for machines that don't run it).

Plus one helper: which shift an operator is on for a given date (the Friday
rotation, RULES.md Part 1 §3).

All functions are pure and deterministic.
