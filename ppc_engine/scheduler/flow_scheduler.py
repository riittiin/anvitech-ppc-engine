"""The decoder — turn an order sequence into a concrete, constraint-legal schedule.

``decode(orders, sequence, masters, config) -> Schedule``

This is the single scheduler (LESSONS.md: one scheduler only) and a pure function of
its inputs (deterministic — same inputs, same schedule). The optimizer will call it
thousands of times over different sequences; this file never knows about the
objective (that lives in engine/objective).

Decode policy (v1, operation-level, non-delay):
  Repeatedly, look at every unfinished order's *next* operation, compute the earliest
  time it could feasibly start, and schedule the one that can start earliest — with
  the order *sequence* breaking ties (so the sequence, the optimizer's lever, decides
  who wins a contended machine). Each operation is laid across real working windows
  (shifts, off-days, leave), staffed by a stable per-shift operator.

See ARCHITECTURE.md "Scheduler v1 scope" for what is intentionally deferred
(piece-flow chunking, operation overlap, coarse idle-operator reassignment) — those
are later, measured layers, not hidden flags.
