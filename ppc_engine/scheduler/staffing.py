"""Operator↔machine staffing — this is where the STABILITY rule is enforced.

The rule that this whole rebuild exists for (RULES.md Rule 1, LESSONS.md "the
decisive one"): **one operator mans one machine for a whole shift; no hour-by-hour
hopping.** This board makes that true by construction:

  - An assignment is keyed by (machine, shift-date, shift). Once a person is put on a
    machine for a shift, that is fixed for the whole shift.
  - A person can be committed to at most ONE machine per shift (tracked in ``_busy``).
  - The decoder only ever asks this board for an operator *per shift*, never
    per-hour — so a ping-ponging schedule simply cannot be expressed.

The board is READ-ONLY during evaluation: the decoder computes a tentative placement
by reading committed assignments and accumulating the *new* assignments it would make
in a local list, committing them only for the placement it actually chooses. (Within
one operation each (machine, shift-date, shift) is touched at most once, so no local
overlay is needed while laying a single operation.)
