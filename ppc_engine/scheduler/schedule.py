"""The schedule result — what the decoder produces.

A Schedule is a flat list of Segments (each a piece of an operation running on a
machine, by an operator, over a time window) plus convenience lookups. It is the
engine's *complete* output — the API/web only render it, they never rebuild it
(LESSONS.md: engine owns its output).
