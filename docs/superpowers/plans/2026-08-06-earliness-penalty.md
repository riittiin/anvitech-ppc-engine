# Earliness Penalty Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Make the optimizer stop scheduling work that finishes more than 4 days before its delivery date, without ever increasing total late-days.

**Architecture:** A linear penalty term is added to both mirrored scorers (`engine/optimizer.score` and `ppc_engine/objective/objective.score`), reading signed lateness that both already compute. A no-regression gate on `total_late_days` is added to both apply paths so the penalty can never buy tidiness with lateness. Weights are then set by measurement, not by choice.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3, pytest, openpyxl. No new dependencies.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-06-earliness-penalty-design.md`

## Global Constraints

- **Grace period is exactly 4 days.** Finishing 4 days early or less costs nothing.
- **Penalty is LINEAR, never squared.** Unlike `_severity`, `_ceiling_breach` and `_committed_promise_breach`, which all square their overage. Reason in spec §3.1.
- **The two scorers must agree numerically.** `EARLINESS_WEIGHT` in `engine/optimizer.py` and `earliness_weight` in `ppc_engine/config.py` must hold identical values, as `SEVERITY_*` already do.
- **Never worsen lateness.** No applied plan may have a higher `total_late_days` than the incumbent.
- **Additive and inert by default.** With no order beyond the grace, the term is 0.0 and every plan must be byte-identical to today.
- **Do not touch:** the scheduler, any rule, any UI, Settings, `engine/new_engine.py`, `engine/config.py`, freeze, absences, or the contest payload.
- **All 508 existing tests must stay green.**
- Constants carry the house comment: measured, must stay equal, re-measure before moving.

### Task 1: Engine-side metric and score term

**Files:**
- Modify: `engine/optimizer.py` (constants after line 64; `plan_metrics` around lines 136-172; `score` lines 85-94)
- Test: `tests/test_earliness_metric.py` (create)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing from earlier tasks.
- Produces: module constants `EARLINESS_GRACE_DAYS: float` and `EARLINESS_WEIGHT: float`; a new key `"earliness_breach": float` in the dict returned by `optimizer.plan_metrics(...)`; `optimizer.score(metrics: dict) -> float` now reads that key via `.get`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Create `tests/test_earliness_metric.py`:

```python
"""Earliness penalty, engine side (spec 2026-08-06 §4.2).

The optimizer could not tell "delivered on the due date" from "delivered 37 days
early" — every scoring term was one-sided. This adds the missing term.

LINEAR, not squared (spec §3.1): earliness harm scales with the contended machine
time an order eats, not with how early it is. On the live book a 37-days-early
11-piece order caused 38h of others' waiting while a 10-days-early 400-piece order
caused 558h — squaring would chase the wrong one 30x harder.

```

Expected: FAIL. `KeyError: 'earliness_breach'` on the metric tests, and
`AttributeError: module 'engine.optimizer' has no attribute 'EARLINESS_WEIGHT'`
on the last one.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the constants**

In `engine/optimizer.py`, immediately after the `COMMITTED_PROMISE_WEIGHT = 5000.0`
block (line 64), add:

```python
# Earliness penalty (2026-08-06 spec). Anvitech does not want stock built weeks
# before the customer will take it: it ties up cash and floor space, and it eats
# contended machine time that late orders are queued for. Measured on the live book
# 2026-08-06: 7 orders finished >4d early and 751.4h of other orders' waiting was
# attributable to them (4.3% of all machine-contention waiting).
#
# LINEAR, deliberately NOT squared like the four guards above. Earliness harm scales
# with the contended machine time the order consumes, not with how early it is: a
# 37-days-early 11-piece order caused 38h of others' waiting while a 10-days-early
# 400-piece order caused 558h. A convex curve would chase the first 30x harder than
# the second. Spec §3.1.
#
# Must stay numerically EQUAL to ppc_engine/config.py earliness_* — the contest
# winner-pick and the sequence search must judge earliness the same way.
# Re-measure before moving (spec §6).
EARLINESS_GRACE_DAYS = 4.0    # == ppc_engine earliness_grace_days
EARLINESS_WEIGHT = 20.0       # == ppc_engine earliness_weight; PLACEHOLDER until Task 6
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Add the metric**

In `engine/optimizer.py:plan_metrics`, after the `committed_promise_breach` loop and
before the `result = {` dict (currently around line 162), add:

```python
    # Earliness beyond the grace, LINEAR (spec §3.1). `gaps` is signed: a negative
    # gap is an order finishing early, which every other term ignores entirely.
    earliness_breach = 0.0
    for g in gaps:
        over = -g - EARLINESS_GRACE_DAYS
        if over > 0:
            earliness_breach += float(over)
```

Then add one key to the `result` dict, after `"committed_promise_breach"`:

```python
        "earliness_breach": round(earliness_breach, 2),
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Add the term to score**

In `engine/optimizer.py:score`, add a final line to the returned expression:

```python
def score(metrics: dict) -> float:
    """Lower is better: lateness + makespan + convex slip guard + worst-order ceiling
    barrier + committed-promise ceiling + earliness penalty. Each added term reads a
    field plan_metrics supplies; ``.get`` keeps legacy metrics dicts safe
    (byte-identical when the field is absent/zero)."""
    return (metrics["total_late_days"]
            + MAKESPAN_WEIGHT * metrics["makespan_days"]
            + SEVERITY_WEIGHT * metrics.get("slip_severity", 0.0)
            + CEILING_WEIGHT * metrics.get("ceiling_breach", 0.0)
            + COMMITTED_PROMISE_WEIGHT * metrics.get("committed_promise_breach", 0.0)
            + EARLINESS_WEIGHT * metrics.get("earliness_breach", 0.0))
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the tests to verify they pass**

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_earliness_metric.py -v
```

Expected: 7 passed.

- [ ] **Step 7: Run the full suite**

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

Expected: all pass. If anything fails, the term is not inert somewhere — investigate
before continuing; do not adjust the failing test to match.

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit**

```bash
git add engine/optimizer.py tests/test_earliness_metric.py
git commit -m "feat: earliness breach metric and score term (engine side)

Linear penalty on days an order finishes more than 4 early. Deliberately not
squared like the other four guards: earliness harm scales with contended machine
time consumed, not with how early the order is (spec 2026-08-06 section 3.1).

Weight is a placeholder until the measurement stage sets it.

### Task 3: Mirror guard

The 400x makespan divergence (`engine/optimizer.py:40` is `40.0`, `ppc_engine/config.py:87`

This task installs that guard.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `optimizer.EARLINESS_GRACE_DAYS`, `optimizer.EARLINESS_WEIGHT` (Task 1);
  `PlanConfig.earliness_grace_days`, `PlanConfig.earliness_weight` (Task 2).
- Produces: nothing consumed downstream.

```python
"""The two scorers must judge a plan the same way.

    assert engine_breach == ppc_breach
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the tests**

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_earliness_mirror.py -v
```

Expected: 4 passed. If `test_earliness_constants_are_mirrored` fails, Task 1 and
Task 2 used different numbers — fix the constants, not the test.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/test_earliness_mirror.py
git commit -m "test: guard that the two scorers stay mirrored

The 400x makespan divergence (40.0 vs 0.1) survived because nothing asserted the
mirror invariant both files' comments promise. Pins the earliness and severity
constants as equal, and pins the makespan pair at their known-divergent values so
the measurement task has to update this deliberately.

### Task 4: Lateness no-regression gate on both apply paths

**Files:**
- Modify: `api/main.py:1779-1802` (`_auto_apply_result`)
- Modify: `api/main.py:2416-2421` (`optimize_apply_ep`)
- Test: `tests/test_earliness_backstop.py` (create)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `optimizer.score` from Task 1; the existing `_incumbent_metrics() -> dict`
  which returns at least `total_late_days`, `makespan_days`, `max_late_days`,
  `max_committed_slip`.
- Produces: no new callable. `_optimize_apply()` stays a pure persist function with
  no gate inside it, so its other caller is unaffected.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Create `tests/test_earliness_backstop.py`:

```python
"""Lateness no-regression gate (spec 2026-08-06 §5.2).

Owner's rule: the earliness penalty may reorder work freely, but a plan that
reduces earliness at the cost of MORE total late-days must never be applied.

Weight ratios cannot enforce this — the raw total_late_days term is only 3.4% of
the live score, the rest being the convex severity curve. So it is enforced
structurally, at the apply gate, on BOTH paths.

Expected: FAIL. The auto regression test applies when it should refuse; the manual
regression test raises no `HTTPException`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the gate to the auto path**

In `api/main.py:_auto_apply_result`, after the `promise_ok` line, add:

```python
    # Earliness must never be bought with lateness (2026-08-06 spec §5.2). The
    # in-search weight is only a hint: total_late_days is 3.4% of the live score,
    # so a plan CAN win on score while delivering more days late. This is the
    # structural guarantee.
    lateness_ok = best.get("total_late_days", 0) <= inc.get("total_late_days", 0)
```

Change the apply condition to include it:

```python
    if optimizer.score(best) < optimizer.score(inc) and worst_ok and promise_ok and lateness_ok:
```

Add a matching branch, immediately before the final `else:`:

```python
    elif not lateness_ok:
        regress = best.get("total_late_days", 0) - inc.get("total_late_days", 0)
        _auto_note_write(f"Checked {stamp}: kept the current plan — the best "
                         f"alternative finished less work early but delivered "
                         f"{regress} more late-days.")
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Add the gate to the manual path**

Replace `api/main.py:optimize_apply_ep` with:

```python
@app.post("/optimize/apply")
def optimize_apply_ep(request: Request):
    """Persist the last completed run's optimized order — every Plan replays it.
    Admin only.

    Gated on the same no-regression rule as the auto path (2026-08-06 spec §5.2):
    a plan that delivers more total late-days than the current one is refused, even
    when an admin presses Apply deliberately. Before that spec this endpoint applied
    unconditionally, so the worst-order and committed-promise guards were also
    bypassed here; the lateness rule now holds on both paths.
    """
    require_admin(request)
    with _OPTIMIZE_LOCK:
        res = _OPTIMIZE.get("result") or {}
        best = res.get("best")
    if best:
        try:
            inc = _incumbent_metrics()
        except Exception:  # noqa: BLE001 — never block Apply on a comparison failure
            inc = None
        if inc and best.get("total_late_days", 0) > inc.get("total_late_days", 0):
            regress = best.get("total_late_days", 0) - inc.get("total_late_days", 0)
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=409,
                detail=(f"Not applied: this plan delivers {regress} more late-days "
                        f"than the current one "
                        f"({best.get('total_late_days')} vs {inc.get('total_late_days')})."))
    return _optimize_apply()
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the tests to verify they pass**

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_earliness_backstop.py -v
```

Expected: 5 passed.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the neighbouring gate tests, then the full suite**

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_promise_backstop.py tests/test_auto_optimize.py tests/test_optimize_endpoints.py -v
python -m pytest -q
```

Expected: all pass. `test_optimize_endpoints.py` exercises the manual Apply path and
is the most likely place to surface an unintended behaviour change — if it fails,
read the failure carefully before touching it.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add api/main.py tests/test_earliness_backstop.py
git commit -m "feat: refuse any applied plan that increases total late-days

The earliness penalty must never be paid for with lateness. Weight ratios cannot
guarantee that (raw late-days is 3.4% of the live score; the convex severity term
is 81%), so the rule is enforced at the apply gate instead.

Applied to the manual Apply button as well, which previously applied
unconditionally with no guards at all.

### Task 5: Measurement harness

**Files:**
- Create: `scripts/measure_earliness.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `optimizer.EARLINESS_WEIGHT`, `optimizer.MAKESPAN_WEIGHT` (Task 1);
  `PlanConfig.earliness_weight`, `PlanConfig.makespan_weight` (Task 2).
- Produces: a CLI reporting `late_days`, `makespan_days` and `earliness_breach` per
  weight combination. Consumed by a human in Task 6, not by code.

**Measurement basis and its limitation.** The harness runs on a workbook
(`Test9.xlsx`), which carries the real masters and SO list but **not** the recorded
production actuals the live book has. Absolute numbers will therefore differ from
live. The comparison between weight settings on one identical book is what this
measures, and that is valid. Final confirmation is a live deep-search after deploy.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the harness**

Create `scripts/measure_earliness.py`:

```python
"""Measure the earliness penalty and the makespan weight (spec 2026-08-06 §6).

Runs the optimizer over a workbook at several weight settings and reports the three
numbers the ship criterion needs. Read-only: touches no store, no live site.

    python scripts/measure_earliness.py Test9.xlsx --budget 150

### Task 6: Run the measurement and set the final weights

This task has no predetermined outcome. **It may end in shipping nothing**, which the
owner accepted explicitly (spec §6).

**Files:**
- Modify: `engine/optimizer.py` (`EARLINESS_WEIGHT`, possibly `MAKESPAN_WEIGHT`)
- Modify: `ppc_engine/config.py` (`earliness_weight`, possibly `makespan_weight`)
- Modify: `tests/test_earliness_mirror.py` (the pinned makespan values, if changed)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `scripts/measure_earliness.py` from Task 5.
- Produces: final constant values; no new callable.

- [ ] **Step 1: Run the full measurement**

```bash
python scripts/measure_earliness.py Test9.xlsx --budget 400 2>&1 | tee /tmp/earliness-measurement.txt
```

This takes a while — roughly 400 evals per line, twelve lines. Record the output.

- [ ] **Step 2: Apply the ship criterion**

For each stage-2 candidate, check both conditions against stage 1:

- `earliness_breach` strictly DOWN, and
- `total_late_days` NOT UP.

Pick the candidate with the largest breach reduction that satisfies both. If none
does, `EARLINESS_WEIGHT` stays `0.0` and the feature ships inert — report that
plainly rather than relaxing the criterion.

- [ ] **Step 3: Report the stage-3 makespan numbers to the owner and stop**

Do **not** choose the makespan weight. Present the four rows (late-days and makespan
for 0.1 / 1 / 10 / 40) and let the owner decide, because it is a business trade
between a shorter schedule and fewer late deliveries (spec §6.1).

Named risk to state alongside the numbers: makespan is 15.8% of the score, so
dropping to 0.1 leaves severity at ~97% and may stretch the schedule badly. A large
makespan increase in that row is a signal to stay near 40.

- [ ] **Step 4: Set the constants**

Replace both placeholder weights with the measured values, keeping them equal:

- `engine/optimizer.py`: `EARLINESS_WEIGHT = <measured>`
- `ppc_engine/config.py`: `earliness_weight: float = <measured>`

Replace the `PLACEHOLDER until ...` comments with the measured evidence, in the house
style. Example shape, with the real numbers substituted:

```python
# MEASURED on Test9.xlsx (2026-08-06, budget 400): weight 20 cut earliness_breach
# 61 -> 12 with total_late_days unchanged at NNN; weight 50 cut breach further but
# added N late-days (rejected by the ship criterion); weight 5 barely moved it.
# Re-measure before moving.
```

If the makespan weight changed, update both files **and** the pinned values in
`tests/test_earliness_mirror.py::test_makespan_weights_are_pinned_and_known_to_diverge`,
renaming that test to reflect the new state.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the full suite**

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

Expected: all pass, including the mirror test with the new values.

- [ ] **Step 6: Confirm the golden trace is unaffected**

```bash
python -m pytest -k golden -v
```

Expected: pass without regeneration. The golden trace covers Rules 1-6 and does not
run the optimizer, so the score change should not reach it. **If it fails, stop and
investigate** — do not run `REGEN_GOLDEN=1`, because a changed golden here would mean
the term leaked into the planning path, which the spec forbids.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add engine/optimizer.py ppc_engine/config.py tests/test_earliness_mirror.py
git commit -m "feat: set the measured earliness weight

<paste the measurement summary: baseline, chosen weight, breach and late-day deltas>

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

---

## Deployment note

Render auto-deploys every push to `main`, so **do not push until Task 6 is complete
and the owner has approved the measured weights**. Landing Tasks 1-5 on `main` would
put a placeholder weight of 20.0 into production scheduling.

Work on a branch and merge once the measurement is signed off.

## Self-Review

**Spec coverage:**

| Spec section | Task |
|---|---|
| §3 grace = 4 days | 1, 2 (constants) |
| §3.1 linear not convex | 1, 2 (implementation + `test_linear_not_squared`) |
| §4 architecture, four files | 1, 2, 4 |
| §4.1 ppc `_earliness_breach` | 2 |
| §4.2 engine `plan_metrics` | 1 |
| §4.3 per SO-line measurement | 1 (`plan_metrics` is per SO-line by construction) |
| §5.1 weight ratios insufficient | 4 (rationale in the gate comment) |
| §5.2 gate on both apply paths | 4 |
| §6 four-stage measurement | 5, 6 |
| §6.1 makespan is a measurement | 5 (stage 3), 6 (step 3: owner decides) |
| §7 five test files | 1, 2, 3, 4 (inert case folded into 1 and 2) |
| §8 scope boundary | Global Constraints |
| §9 placeholder weight | 1, 2 land it; 6 replaces it |

No gaps.

**Placeholder scan:** The only `<measured>` / `<paste ...>` markers are in Task 6,
where the value is the deliverable of the task itself and the criterion for choosing
it is fully specified. No "TBD", no "add error handling", no "similar to Task N".

**Type consistency:** `earliness_breach` is the dict key in Tasks 1, 3, 4 and 5.
`_earliness_breach` is the ppc function name in Tasks 2 and 3.
`earliness_grace_days` / `earliness_weight` are the `PlanConfig` fields in Tasks 2, 3
and 5. `EARLINESS_GRACE_DAYS` / `EARLINESS_WEIGHT` are the module constants in Tasks
1, 3 and 5. `lateness_ok` appears only in Task 4. Checked and consistent.
